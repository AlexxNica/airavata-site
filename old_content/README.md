# Apache Airavata website

This is next generation website for [Apache Airavata](http://airavata.apache.org).

### About this site
Initial version of the site will be plain HTML and will eventually be replaced by a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based site.

The git repo will only have one branch asf-site and the parent folder will have mark down files. Jekyll will be used to generate the HTML. The generated files will be served from 'content' folder.

Currently only the 'content' folder will be populated.
